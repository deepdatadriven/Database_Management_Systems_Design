# Database_Management_Systems_Design
CS 631 - Data Management Systems Design - (NJIT Spring 2017)

#### Overview 

The objective of the course is to give an advanced presentation of the concepts of designing, organizing, querying and managing relational databases. It deals with both the theoretical and the practical aspects of database systems. It builds on the material covered by the undergraduate database course CS431. 

The students learn the latest of the SQL standard and get hands on experience on creating, populating, querying, maintaining and managing a relational database using a modern database management system. 

#### Prerequisites 

The students should have knowledge of a programming language, and a background on algorithms, data structures and file organization. They are also expected to know the basics of relational databases. 

#### Material that Must be Covered During the Semester. 

1. Conceptual Modeling: the Entity-Relationship (ER) model and the enhanced ER model. 
2. The Relational Model: concepts, integrity constraints, update operations, relational algebra. 
3. From Conceptual Models to Logical Models: mapping the ER model to the relational model. 
4. The Standard Database Language SQL: data definition, integrity constraints, schema changes, basic and complex queries, aggregate functions and grouping, data change statements, views, complex constraints, embedded SQL, cursors, dynamic SQL, JDBC. 
5. Active Databases: active database rules, triggers. 
6. Database Physical Organization: file organizations, external hashing, indexing, B-trees. 
7. Query Evaluation: operator evaluation, algorithms for relational operators, query optimization. 
8. Formal Database Design Theory: functional and other dependencies, dependency inference, normal forms, schema decomposition, normalization. 
9. Database Management System Implementation Issues: transaction processing, concurrency control.
